A portfolio is a collection of work that shows a person’s skills, experience, and achievements. It is commonly used by students, designers, developers, and professionals to present their best projects. A portfolio helps others understand what you can do and how well you can do it. It can be in digital or physical form, often as a website. Portfolios are useful for jobs, internships, and academic opportunities.
